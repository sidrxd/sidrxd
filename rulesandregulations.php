                            <p class="team-details__text">With regard to the Supreme Court Judgment and guidelines issued in 1997 to provide for the effective enforcement of the basic human right of gender equality and guarantee against sexual harassment and abuse, more particularly against sexual harassment at work places and schools, CBSE has issued circulars since 2004 to all the schools, advising them to establish a permanent cell and a committee and to develop guidelines to combat sexual harassment,
                            violence against women and bullying at the schools. The Protection of Children from Sexual
                            Offences Act & Rules, 2012 deals with all manners of sexual offences, reporting mechanisms
                            and subsequent penal consequences. Keeping this in mind, the Government of NCT of Delhi
                            hopes to tackle the issues with a set of multidisciplinary prevention guidelines which are
                            supported by legal provisions under the Delhi Juvenile Justice (Care and
                            Protection of Children) Rules, 2009 and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act7
                            2012. These guidelines serve as a method for numerous stakeholders from teachers to
                            community welfare associations to the police to ensure that all possible steps are taken to
                            prevent Child Abuse and empower children to "recognize symptoms of potentially abusive
                            situations. It has further advised the schools to be proactive by developing a conducive
                            atmosphere on the campus, where the status of woman/ girl student is respected and they are
                            treated equally without any bias or discrimination. Keeping the above guidelines in view,
                            SHASHI INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL, Tundla, has constituted a Committee Against Sexual
                            Harassment.
